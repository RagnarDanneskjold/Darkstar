Need to build a symbol table of sorts for 8085 code to allow mapping of ROM addresses
to source lines & symbol names in source code.

Current thoughts:
Text file consisting of lines in the format:

$<ROM Address>-[length]: <source file name>, <line number>

to describe instruction mapping or label/constant value definition -> source line.
Duplicate <ROM Address> fields may be present to describe symbols pointing to same address

Start with ROM addresses that correspond directly to labels, see how interpolation (based on
assembly of source, perhaps?) can deal with the intermediary addresses.
