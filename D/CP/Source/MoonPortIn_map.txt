                # This file maps assembly source symbols to PROM/microcode addresses and source lines, forming a crude
                # symbol table.
                #
                # Each source file is given a header a la:
                # [FooSource.asm]
                # (with brackets)

                # Each line's syntax is:
                # <symbol name 1>, .. , <symbol name N>: <address or value (hex)>,<line number(decimal) in current source file>
                # where '*none*' is a special symbol name meaning no symbol mapping is present.
